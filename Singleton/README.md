In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation 
of a class to a singular instance. One of the well-known "Gang of Four" design patterns, which describe how to 
solve recurring problems in object-oriented software,[1] the pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed 
to coordinate actions across a system.
